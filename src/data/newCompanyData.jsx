        "description": "Launched in 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began exposing key infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now widely known as cloud computing. The ultimate benefit of cloud computing, and AWS, is the ability to leverage a new business model and turn capital infrastructure expenses into variable costs. Businesses no longer need to plan and procure servers and other IT resources weeks or months in advance. Using AWS, businesses can take advantage of Amazon's expertise and economies of scale to access resources when their business needs them, delivering results faster and at a lower cost.\n\nToday, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. With data center locations in the U.S., Europe, Singapore, and Japan, customers across all industries are taking advantage of our low cost, elastic, open and flexible, secure platform.",

It shows that your actions and words matter and that if you put those two together in a way that allows those quiet voices to be heard, and provides a pathway for all to succeed, then awesome outcomes are possible.”",

This integration complements the School of Dentistry’s focus on training a new generation of dentists who take a bigger-picture approach to oral and medical care. \n\n“This connection gives UCSF Health and UCSF dental clinicians a more complete picture of their patients’ health information, including a shared medication list, and provides new opportunities to coordinate care,” said Suresh Gunasekaran, president and CEO, UCSF Health. “Given the synergistic relationship between oral health and overall wellness, a comprehensive approach to oral and medical care makes sense and positions UCSF to be a leader in breaking down barriers between the fields of dentistry and medicine.”\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #oralhealth",

I don’t have to, because the note captures everything that needs to go to the insurance company,” said Lance Owens, DO, chief medical information officer.\n\nWhat about patients?\n\nPatients reported that they found their visits more engaging than before, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5.\n\nPatients loved seeing their own words in their doctor’s notes. It reassures them that the doctor understands what they’re saying, and their language is more approachable than medical jargon. “One patient told us that he said, ‘I jacked up my knee,’ during a visit, and when he looked at the note in MyChart, it read ‘Patient says he jacked up his knee,’” said Josh Wilda, chief digital and information officer.\n\nCongrats on the great work, folks!\n\nRead more: https://lnkd.in/g68NnWab\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #innovation",

Some docs get notes done in less than 1 min per patient, and many come in under 4 mins per patient.\n\nMore prior authorization requests approved on the first try. “I haven't done a peer-to-peer note review in maybe a year. I don’t have to, because the note captures everything that needs to go to the insurance company,” said Lance Owens, DO, chief medical information officer.\n\nWhat about patients?\n\nPatients reported that they found their visits more engaging than before, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5.\n\nPatients loved seeing their own words in their doctor’s notes. It reassures them that the doctor understands what they’re saying, and their language is more approachable than medical jargon. “One patient told us that he said, ‘I jacked up my knee,’ during a visit, and when he looked at the note in MyChart, it read ‘Patient says he jacked up his knee,’” said Josh Wilda, chief digital and information officer.\n\nCongrats on the great work, folks!\n\nRead more: https://lnkd.in/g68NnWab\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #innovation",

Here are just a few:\n\n1. Efficiency improvements for clinicians and administrators so that more time can be spent with patients. The goal is not only to reduce workloads, but to better balance the remaining workloads across an organization.\n\n2. Technology to support deeper connections with patients and more personalized communication paths through patients’ preferred channels, including MyChart and SMS.\n\n3. Data discovery through Cosmos to facilitate research, clinical trials, and other life sciences efforts.\n\nFrom Seth: “For 2023, I believe we will see continued rapid adoption of technology. COVID-19 showed us that we can implement new technology quickly in healthcare AND realize the benefits quickly as well. With the continued difficult economic climate, healthcare organizations will have to do more with less and technology can be a great way to achieve efficiencies. We will see more tech being adopted more quickly because we need those efficiencies in 2023.”\n\nRead more: https://lnkd.in/dRAQHbuu\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #2023",

It reassures them that the doctor understands what they’re saying, and their language is more approachable than medical jargon. “One patient told us that he said, ‘I jacked up my knee,’ during a visit, and when he looked at the note in MyChart, it read ‘Patient says he jacked up his knee,’” said Josh Wilda, chief digital and information officer.\n\nCongrats on the great work, folks!\n\nRead more: https://lnkd.in/g68NnWab\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #innovation",

We can avoid an emergency department visit, which benefits the patients and our healthcare system.”\n\nCheck out more from Carle: https://lnkd.in/g_9wrg96.\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #innovation",

Here are just a few:\n\n1. Efficiency improvements for clinicians and administrators so that more time can be spent with patients. The goal is not only to reduce workloads, but to better balance the remaining workloads across an organization.\n\n2. Technology to support deeper connections with patients and more personalized communication paths through patients’ preferred channels, including MyChart and SMS.\n\n3. Data discovery through Cosmos to facilitate research, clinical trials, and other life sciences efforts.\n\nFrom Seth: “For 2023, I believe we will see continued rapid adoption of technology. COVID-19 showed us that we can implement new technology quickly in healthcare AND realize the benefits quickly as well. With the continued difficult economic climate, healthcare organizations will have to do more with less and technology can be a great way to achieve efficiencies. We will see more tech being adopted more quickly because we need those efficiencies in 2023.”\n\nRead more: https://lnkd.in/dRAQHbuu\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #2023",

I don’t have to, because the note captures everything that needs to go to the insurance company,” said Lance Owens, DO, chief medical information officer.\n\nWhat about patients?\n\nPatients reported that they found their visits more engaging than before, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5.\n\nPatients loved seeing their own words in their doctor’s notes. It reassures them that the doctor understands what they’re saying, and their language is more approachable than medical jargon. “One patient told us that he said, ‘I jacked up my knee,’ during a visit, and when he looked at the note in MyChart, it read ‘Patient says he jacked up his knee,’” said Josh Wilda, chief digital and information officer.\n\nCongrats on the great work, folks!\n\nRead more: https://lnkd.in/g68NnWab\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #innovation",

Here are just a few:\n\n1. Efficiency improvements for clinicians and administrators so that more time can be spent with patients. The goal is not only to reduce workloads, but to better balance the remaining workloads across an organization.\n\n2. Technology to support deeper connections with patients and more personalized communication paths through patients’ preferred channels, including MyChart and SMS.\n\n3. Data discovery through Cosmos to facilitate research, clinical trials, and other life sciences efforts.\n\nFrom Seth: “For 2023, I believe we will see continued rapid adoption of technology. COVID-19 showed us that we can implement new technology quickly in healthcare AND realize the benefits quickly as well. With the continued difficult economic climate, healthcare organizations will have to do more with less and technology can be a great way to achieve efficiencies. We will see more tech being adopted more quickly because we need those efficiencies in 2023.”\n\nRead more: https://lnkd.in/dRAQHbuu\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #2023",

Experts from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Mount Sinai, and Johns Hopkins also appear in the article.\n\nSome key numbers from the analysis:\n \n● 4.9 million US patients who had COVID were included in the study.\n\n● 1/12 people infected with during the first year of the pandemic sought care for long-COVID-like symptoms within several months of infection.\n\n● 1/16 people infected with Omicron sought care for long-COVID-like symptoms within several months of infection.\n\n● Patients with certain underlying conditions were twice as likely as previously healthy people to seek care for long-COVID-like symptoms.\n\nWhat caused the change in rates? And why do some people experience long COVID while others don’t? As the writers point out, it’s hard to say—“the precise nature of long covid and the remedies for it reside in a black box.” Or, in the words of Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at Washington University School of Medicine, “Long covid is a complicated beast.” \n\nRead more from the Washington Post: https://lnkd.in/gZEsDE7W\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #covid19",

                "description": "For many health systems, finding the right clinical trials for their patients can be time-consuming and challenging, making it hard to provide potentially life-saving treatments to those in need. To make it easier to connect with the right opportunities, health systems in the Epic community can participate in Clinical Trial Matchmaking (CTM).\n\nUsing Cosmos, the CTM program connects health systems with sponsored research opportunities suited to the patients they treat. This increases the number of clinical trials that a health system can consider while minimizing the time they spend evaluating each one. Ultimately, the goal is clinical trials that are 1) more efficient, 2) more diverse, and as a result, 3) more effective for patients. \n\nIf you represent a provider organization interested in CTM, send us an email at LifeSciences@epic.com\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #research",

Experts from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Mount Sinai, and Johns Hopkins also appear in the article.\n\nSome key numbers from the analysis:\n \n● 4.9 million US patients who had COVID were included in the study.\n\n● 1/12 people infected with during the first year of the pandemic sought care for long-COVID-like symptoms within several months of infection.\n\n● 1/16 people infected with Omicron sought care for long-COVID-like symptoms within several months of infection.\n\n● Patients with certain underlying conditions were twice as likely as previously healthy people to seek care for long-COVID-like symptoms.\n\nWhat caused the change in rates? And why do some people experience long COVID while others don’t? As the writers point out, it’s hard to say—“the precise nature of long covid and the remedies for it reside in a black box.” Or, in the words of Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at Washington University School of Medicine, “Long covid is a complicated beast.” \n\nRead more from the Washington Post: https://lnkd.in/gZEsDE7W\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #covid19",

                "description": "Have you heard of the adventures of the Epic Web-Man? Here’s a throw-back as told by Judy.\n\n“Twenty years ago, we created a 3-part series of comic books called ‘Adventures of Epic Web-Man.’ They were a hoot! They were 20 cents each (which we never collected), and on one of them there was an order form for $5.99 for an ‘Unsupported Hyperbole Decoder Ring.’ A few people actually sent us orders. (We refunded their money and sent them Epic wear.)\n\n“We asked Aaron to hand out our comic books at the HIMSS conference. He was to wear a superhero Epic Web-Man costume, sit atop a ladder next to the aisle, and offer the comic books to passers-by. They were enormously popular.\n\n“Aaron was a young man who in his everyday life was an excellent accountant on our staff. He processed trip expense reports with great care and thoroughness, examining every receipt. This was his first business trip. He got off the plane and into a waiting cab. Then, when the cab driver dropped him off, the cab driver handed Aaron a BLANK receipt. Blank! It blew Aaron's mind. It was almost a crisis time for him. As someone said later, ‘It was a good thing the driver didn't hand him three blank receipts.’ Aaron recovered and did a great job as Epic Web-Man, but I suspect his view of expense reports was never quite the same after that.”\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #companyculture",

Experts from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Mount Sinai, and Johns Hopkins also appear in the article.\n\nSome key numbers from the analysis:\n \n● 4.9 million US patients who had COVID were included in the study.\n\n● 1/12 people infected with during the first year of the pandemic sought care for long-COVID-like symptoms within several months of infection.\n\n● 1/16 people infected with Omicron sought care for long-COVID-like symptoms within several months of infection.\n\n● Patients with certain underlying conditions were twice as likely as previously healthy people to seek care for long-COVID-like symptoms.\n\nWhat caused the change in rates? And why do some people experience long COVID while others don’t? As the writers point out, it’s hard to say—“the precise nature of long covid and the remedies for it reside in a black box.” Or, in the words of Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at Washington University School of Medicine, “Long covid is a complicated beast.” \n\nRead more from the Washington Post: https://lnkd.in/gZEsDE7W\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #covid19",

Ultimately, the goal is clinical trials that are 1) more efficient, 2) more diverse, and as a result, 3) more effective for patients. \n\nIf you represent a provider organization interested in CTM, send us an email at LifeSciences@epic.com\n\n#healthcare #healthIT #research",

Guests of our centre are invited to give children who are going to be in hospital this Christmas a treat and make a wish come true.\n\nThe centre’s gifting tree has been decorated with white stars, each marked with a toy in the price range of €5 to €150. Each star can be chosen, and the value of the gift is donated in Guest Services. Taking on the role of Santa’s elves, the centre staff will then purchase the present on the guest’s behalf.  \n\nSo far, the centre has collected over €3000 and still has three weeks left to collect more wishes. All gifts will then be donated to the children’s ward at Friedrich Ebert Hospital in Neumünster, providing Christmas magic to those who deserve it most. \n\nLast year, the centre collected more than 150 gifts worth €2,650. On top of the gifts, the Centre donated €20,000 to the hospital which was used for children's psychological support and two paediatric lung machines. \n\n#McArthurGlen #DesignerOutlet #Neumünster #GiftingTree #Christmas",

Our Serravalle centre was ranked the most successful in Italy (and third in Europe), with Castel Romano and Noventa di Piave second and third respectively. Our centres in Roermond, Troyes, Parndorf and East Midlands also appeared on the list. \n \nOur ranking and dominance in this year’s OCPRE demonstrates our reputation amongst our valued brand partners, and once again positions McArthurGlen as the market-leading outlet operator.  \n \nMany thanks to all our loyal brand partners for their continued support.  \n\nSusie McCabe Joan Jove Dr. Joachim Will Dr Caroline Lamy John Ralston Kenny Murray Hayden Tucker",

In a hyper-digitized era, Monopoly is a return to play, to socializing, to being together with friends and family, around a table. Precisely for this reason, we have decided that the game will not be for sale, but our gift.\" \n\n#McArthurGlen #DesignerOutlet #LaReggia #MonopolyGame #boardgame #MakingTheExtraordinaryPossible",

And what we found is that by having products that are specifically designed for the rinse, we can create whole new mechanisms that allow people to get better performance than was ever possible with a detergent alone,” said English, who has been with P&G for 25 years. \n\nOh, and if you happen to forget your laundry in the washer after it runs, Downy Rinse & Refresh will smell good even up to 24 hours later! \n\nDowny Rinse & Refresh goes in the softener dispenser of your washer and will dispense when your laundry is in the rinse stage of the cycle. \n \nTo learn more about English’s story: https://lnkd.in/e9brv5GB #PGInnovation",

But if you’re using a premium detergent like Cascade Platinum Plus, no pre-wash is needed. Just scrape, load, and you’re done – all while saving time, water, energy, and money in the process.” \n\nEberhard, an 11-year P&G veteran, is dedicated to making dishwashing a more likeable task.

Most importantly, she is a mentor. \n\n“I am really proud to have been a part of some truly great teams that have launched amazing products, but what really stands out to me is getting to be a mentor and influencing young women to take an interest in science, particularly young Black women who get to see someone who looks like them working in STEM.” \n\nJennifer has been an integral part of uplifting women innovators at P&G, taking part in mentorship programs and workshops. “Exposing young women in the community to the opportunities in STEM, and making an impact in this way is one of my greatest accomplishments.” \n\nOutside of work, Jennifer loves to travel immersing herself in new cities and cultures. “Getting outside your comfort zone and usual surroundings is the best way to learn — the same is true in innovation! You have to think outside the box and look beyond your usual surroundings to solve tough challenges and make breakthroughs!” \n\nLearn more about P&G innovators throughout Black History Month: http://spr.ly/604835Loa #PGInnovation",

Our box is certified for child safety and at the same time inclusively designed to be delightful for adults. The opening experience is incredible for everyone, and especially for people with hand-dexterity challenges. \n\nFor blind and low vision people, we introduced a new tactile symbol that helps identify the product through touch as a laundry detergent. ECOCLIC® also features the NaviLens code, which can be scanned with the phone to locate the product on the shelf and learn more about it. So well deserved for the entire Ariel team behind this #DisabilityConfident invention! \n  \nI also had the privilege to participate in the opening panel session with Pete Matthews and Bethany Foor from Kellogg’s and Marc Powell PLY from RNIB, where we shared our respective companies’ journey on integrating accessibility into our company brand strategy. \n\nThank you Jim Downham and the entire PAC team! It was an awesome and superbly organized event, and I just loved the thoughtful audio description of each of the winning videos, which was definitely appreciated by all 3 of us blind and low vision attendees.",

Leyendecker, produced by P&G and Imagine Entertainment & Television. \n \nThe film explores early representation of LGBTQ+ communities through arts and advertising. Brent Miller, CODED Executive Producer and P&G Senior Director for Global LGBTQ+ Equality, reflects, “despite Leyendecker’s story being one of 100 years ago, it is still of great relevance today. It has created a powerful conversation about the role of advertising and the responsibility corporations have to make equitable choices regarding the ways we represent the humanity of people. We never made this film to win awards, we made it to tell a story and move important issues forward.”\n \nLearn more about CODED and our commitment to visibility by visiting the link here: https://lnkd.in/eiqEuUXK\n \n#UniqueAndUnited",

On top of the 10 pounds of weight, Weaver then adds green-colored water.  \n\n“Bounty’s new proprietary microstructure is larger than our previous design and built to hold up under pressure. You may not see it, but you can feel the difference,” said Weaver. \n\nNew Bounty is hitting store shelves this Spring, just in time for Spring cleaning!
